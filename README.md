# Java-Coding
This repository contains my Java programming projects, covering core Java concepts, data structures and algorithms (DSA), problem-solving solutions, and mini projects. It showcases my learning journey and practical implementation of Java, including topics like OOP, multithreading, exception handling, and more.

Here's an example of what you can write in your GitHub repository's `README.md` file to showcase your Java coding work effectively:

# Java Projects and Code Snippets  

Welcome to my **Java Coding Repository**! üöÄ  

This repository contains a collection of Java projects and code snippets that I have worked on while learning and practicing Java programming. Each folder or file represents a specific project, problem, or concept.  

## üìÇ Contents  

1. **Core Java Basics**  
   - Programs covering loops, arrays, strings, and basic OOP concepts.  
   - Examples: Factorial calculation, string manipulation, and file handling.  

2. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**  
   - Implementation of popular data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, and heaps.  
   - Algorithm-based solutions for sorting, searching, recursion, and more.   

3. **Problem Solving**  
   - Solutions to coding problems from platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and Striver's SDE Sheet.  

4. **Advanced Concepts**  
   - Concepts like multithreading, exception handling, custom classes, and Java collections.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
